    <h2  >My exprience at andela</h2>
      <p>My name is Tibaingana phoebe a new recruit in the Andela Women Initiative program cohort 2.</p>
      <p>I got to know about andela through a friend who encouraged me to join. When I joined andela I didnot expect to find and meet such cool, intelligent and enthusiastic youth who have so much passion in programming.
        Andela is such a place that I have never seen before, the team is so welcoming and encouraging. It is the place you go to and feel at home. You get to meet all kinds of people who have passed through your journey and made it where they are because of andela.
        </p>
       <p>Andela is a company which searches for youth who have a passion in programming and are interested in learning more. Andela trains and transforms these recruits into first class world developers and after that employs them in various software companies. Andela does not only focus on nurturing developers but also nurtures them into future leaders that are confident.
        It is a place every person should be if they are software enthusiasts. The environment will give you the feel of calmness and peace, it is a place you cannot feel intimidated because everyone around you does care about you and always willing to help in any way.
